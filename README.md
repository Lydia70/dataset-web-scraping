Web Scraping with Python

In this repository, I post notebook contributions in which I practice with web scraping in Jupyter Notebook. 
During the last Christmas holiday season, I've posted a nice dataset including Christmas Weather data in Chicago. Will Chicago have a white Christmas? 
I shared a notebook with the creation of the dataset in this repository, and I use web scraping to collect the data.
